# Data

We are planning to use Covid-19 Vaccination data in the United States. We plan on tracking the vaccination 
rate and figure out how soon the whole country/any particular state will be fully vaccinated at the current rate 
and make animations and assumptions about the same.

Because it is virtually impossible for every single person in the United States to get vaccinated, we will be defining “fully vaccinated” as 80% of the population having received 2 doses of the vaccine (although the exact percentage needed to reach herd immunity is still unknown). 
This is definitely a nuanced topic that will be difficult to tackle because there isn’t really a historical precedent and vaccination has only been happening in the U.S. since January (so there’s only about 6 months of data). However, we can use other countries which have over 80% vaccination (ex. Israel and Malta?) as models to compare and base our algorithm off of. 
We will be using our first data set (linked above) for the preliminary model — tracking the rate at which people are getting vaccinated so that we can create a graph with a trend line that will point to the time in which 80% of people will be vaccinated. 
However, there are many factors that affect why people aren’t getting vaccinated and one part of this project will be to factor in other datasets that will inform us about certain demographics (ex. rural or urban, race, political views) of the people living in each state so that we can better estimate the trend line.
